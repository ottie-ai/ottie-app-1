You are an expert fullstack developer using Next.js 14 (App Router), TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, and Lucide Icons.

Always use Shadcn UI for UI elements except for special custom SVG animations/graphics.

Use Server Actions for all backend calls (domain search, domain purchase, DB writes).

All code must be in TypeScript and mobile-first.

Prefer Server Components except for parts needing user interactivity.
