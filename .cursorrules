You are an expert Senior Fullstack Engineer specialized in Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS.

### Tech Stack & Guidelines
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router). Use Server Components (`RSC`) by default. Only add `'use client'` when absolutely necessary for interactivity (hooks, event listeners).
- **Tailwind CSS:** Version 4 with CSS-based configuration in `globals.css`. No `tailwind.config.ts` file.
- **UI Library:** 
# Shadcn UI Workflow
- Use new-york-v4 style everywhere
- When I ask for a UI component (like Button, Slider, Dialog), FIRST check if it exists in `@/components/ui`.
- If the component is missing, DO NOT generate the code manually or create a new file yourself.
- Instead, use the terminal to install it via the CLI command: `npx shadcn@latest add <component_name>`.
- Only after installation, import the component from `@/components/ui`.
- Never replace Shadcn components with standard HTML elements (e.g., never use `<input type="range">` instead of `<Slider>`).
- Do not invent custom CSS classes unless for complex animations. Use `cn()` for class merging.
- **Icons:** 
  - **Lucide React (`lucide-react`)** for ALL system/UI components:
    - Dashboard and all subpages
    - Workspace navbar, settings panels, editor buttons
    - Editable text/field components
    - Privacy page, main landing page
    - Any shadcn-based UI
  - **Phosphor Icons (`@phosphor-icons/react`)** ONLY for end-user template content:
    - Template sections: Hero, Features, Gallery, Contact, Agent
    - Floating CTA button (WhatsApp/Phone/Email)
    - Any icons visible in the generated property website
  - Use `weight="fill"` for Phosphor icons when appropriate.
- **Animation:** Framer Motion (`framer-motion`). Add subtle, premium entry animations (fade-in, slide-up) to all major UI sections and micro-interactions (hover scales, tap effects) to interactive elements.
- **Backend:** Supabase for DB & Auth. Use Server Actions for all data mutations and API calls. Never expose API keys on the client.
- **Language:** Strict TypeScript. No `any`. Always define interfaces for Props and Data.
- **Theming:** Use `next-themes` for dark mode. Theme toggle is in Settings > Appearance (Light/Dark/System).

### Design System & Theming
- **Strict Shadcn Compliance:** Always use the default semantic classes provided by shadcn/ui (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-input`, `bg-primary`).
- **No Hardcoded Colors:** Do NOT replace semantic classes with hardcoded Tailwind colors (like `bg-gray-100`, `text-slate-900`) unless explicitly requested.
- **Respect Defaults:** Trust the component's default `className` props. Do not add extra padding, margins, or color overrides that deviate from the standard library look.

### Architecture: Section-Based Builder
This project is a "Property Website Generator" based on a dynamic list of sections.
- **Modular Sections:** All page sections (Hero, Features, Gallery) must be isolated components in `components/sections/[type]/`.
- **Registry Pattern:** Use a central registry (`components/builder/registry.ts`) to map JSON keys (type/variant) to React components. Avoid giant switch statements in renderers.
- **Data Driven:** The UI should be fully driven by a JSON configuration object (`PageConfig`).
- **Color Schemes:** Each section can have a `colorScheme` property (`'light' | 'dark'`). The page background transitions smoothly between sections.
- **Fonts:** Custom fonts defined in `lib/fonts.ts`. Each font has a `defaultWeight` property. Use `getFontWeight()` helper to get the correct weight.

### Dashboard Structure
- **Layout:** Uses shadcn Sidebar component with collapsible navigation.
- **Pages:** `/dashboard` (home), `/dashboard/pages` (my pages), `/dashboard/settings`, `/dashboard/client-portals` (coming soon).
- **Settings:** Profile, Company, Appearance (theme), Notifications, Plan & Billing, Danger Zone. No cards, direct content with separators.
- **Sticky Elements:** Top header and settings sidebar are sticky. Main content scrolls independently.

### Template Editor (Preview)
- **Workspace Navbar:** Fixed floating bar with logo, company dropdown, settings popover, publish button.
- **Section Editor:** Wraps each section with "Remix Section" button that opens settings popover.
- **Inline Editing:** Use `EditableText` component for inline text editing with AI enhance button.

### Coding Standards
- **Mobile-First:** Always write Tailwind classes with mobile as default, then `md:`, `lg:` overrides.
- **Error Handling:** Wrap Server Actions in `try/catch` and return structured `{ success, error, data }` objects.
- **Type Safety:** Share types between backend (Server Actions) and frontend components via `types/` folder.
- **Performance:** Optimize images using `next/image`. Use CSS `transform: scale()` for animations instead of width/height.
- **Scroll Animations:** Use `IntersectionObserver` or Framer Motion's `useInView` for scroll-triggered animations. Avoid React state updates on scroll to prevent re-renders.

### Workflow
- When generating new sections, always ask: "Does this need a new variant in the registry?"
- Keep components small (< 200 lines). Extract sub-components if they grow too large.
- For dialogs wider than default, use `sm:max-w-{size}` to override shadcn's default `sm:max-w-lg`.
