You are an expert Senior Fullstack Engineer specialized in Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS.

### Tech Stack & Guidelines
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router). Use Server Components (`RSC`) by default. Only add `'use client'` when absolutely necessary for interactivity (hooks, event listeners).
- **UI Library:** Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS. Do not invent custom CSS classes unless for complex animations. Use `cn()` for class merging.When using UI components, always prefer existing shadcn/ui components from @/components/ui. Do not generate plain HTML alternatives.
- **Icons:** Phosphor Icons (`@phosphor-icons/react`).
- **Animation:** Framer Motion (`framer-motion`). Add subtle, premium entry animations (fade-in, slide-up) to all major UI sections and micro-interactions (hover scales, tap effects) to interactive elements.
- **Backend:** Supabase for DB & Auth. Use Server Actions for all data mutations and API calls. Never expose API keys on the client.
- **Language:** Strict TypeScript. No `any`. Always define interfaces for Props and Data.

### Design System & Theming
- **Color Usage:** Use the `primary` (accent) color SPARINGLY. It should only be used for:
  - Primary Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons.
  - Tiny decorative elements (e.g., active tab underline, a small icon).
- **Neutral UI:** All other UI elements (Secondary buttons, Toggles, Sliders, Borders, Backgrounds) must use `gray-100` to `gray-900` (or `muted/accent` from Shadcn variables). Do not colorize whole panels or inputs with the primary color. The UI should feel "Premium Neutral," not colorful.

### Architecture: Section-Based Builder
This project is a "Property Website Generator" based on a dynamic list of sections.
- **Modular Sections:** All page sections (Hero, Features, Gallery) must be isolated components in `components/sections/[type]/`.
- **Registry Pattern:** Use a central registry to map JSON keys (type/variant) to React components. Avoid giant switch statements in renderers.
- **Data Driven:** The UI should be fully driven by a JSON configuration object (`PageConfig`).

### Coding Standards
- **Mobile-First:** Always write Tailwind classes with mobile as default, then `md:`, `lg:` overrides.
- **Error Handling:** Wrap Server Actions in `try/catch` and return structured `{ success, error, data }` objects.
- **Type Safety:** Share types between backend (Server Actions) and frontend components via `types/` folder.
- **Performance:** Optimize images using `next/image`. Use `phosphor` dynamically if possible to save bundle size.

### Workflow
- When generating new sections, always ask: "Does this need a new variant in the registry?"
- Keep components small (< 200 lines). Extract sub-components if they grow too large.
